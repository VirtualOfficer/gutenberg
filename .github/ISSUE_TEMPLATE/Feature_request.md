about: Propose an idea for a feature or an enhancement

---

<!--
Before submitting a feature request, please take some time to read and consider
how your idea aligns with the WordPress philosophy.

https://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/

In particular:

- Is extra configuration required? WordPress should work out of the box.
- Will the average user understand this? WordPress should be designed for the majority.
- Are extra options required? WordPress should offer decisions, not options.
- Will 80% of users appreciate and use this? (Can this instead be a plugin?) WordPress should remain clean and lean.
- Does this improve ease of use? WordPress should strive for simplicity.
