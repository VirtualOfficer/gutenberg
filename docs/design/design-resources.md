# Design Resources

The [SketchPress](https://github.com/10up/SketchPress) project includes a library of Gutenberg design components, and is incredibly helpful for designing and prototyping Gutenberg and Gutenberg blocks:

[Download Sketch mockups & patterns files](https://github.com/10up/SketchPress)

These components are built to be used in [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com) for Mac. Users on other platforms may have luck importing the file to [Figma](https://www.figma.com) (Mac/Windows/Linux) or [Lunacy](https://icons8.com/lunacy) (Windows).

Please note that these are meant as mockups, so they may not be 1:1 accurate. It is also possible that the Sketch files aren’t up-to-date with the latest Gutenberg itself, as development sometimes moves faster than updating of the Sketch files.

If you have questions, please don’t hesitate to ask in the #design channel on the WordPress community Slack.
