The Interactivity API is a reactive and declarative framework, similar to other modern frameworks like React, Vue, Svelte, or Alpine. When working with the Interactivity API, adopting the right mindset is crucial for maximizing its potential. This guide will explain the core concepts of reactivity and declarativeness, providing a foundation for effective use of the Interactivity API.

## Understanding Declarative vs. Imperative Code

**Declarative Programming** describes _what_ a program should accomplish. It focuses on the desired outcome without explicitly listing commands or steps to achieve that result. In contrast, **imperative programming** specifies _how_ to accomplish tasks by explicitly stating each step to manipulate the programâ€™s state.

### Imperative Approach

In the early days of web development, the imperative approach was predominant. This method involves manually updating the DOM with JavaScript to reflect changes.

Take for example this application with two buttons and a paragraph:

- **The show/hide button**: Toggles paragraph visibility and enables/disables the "Activate" button.
- **The activate button**: Toggles the paragraph's text and color between "active" (green) and "inactive" (red).

```html
<button
  id="show-hide-btn"
  aria-expanded="false"
  aria-controls="status-paragraph"
>
  show
</button>
<button id="activate-btn" disabled>activate</button>
<p id="status-paragraph" class="inactive" hidden>this is inactive</p>

<script>
  const showHideBtn = document.getElementById('show-hide-btn');
  const activateBtn = document.getElementById('activate-btn');
  const statusParagraph = document.getElementById('status-paragraph');

  showHideBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
    if (statusParagraph.hasAttribute('hidden')) {
      statusParagraph.removeAttribute('hidden');
      showHideBtn.textContent = 'hide';
      showHideBtn.setAttribute('aria-expanded', 'true');
      activateBtn.removeAttribute('disabled');
    } else {
      if (statusParagraph.classList.contains('active')) {
        statusParagraph.textContent = 'this is inactive';
        statusParagraph.classList.remove('active');
        activateBtn.textContent = 'activate';
      }
      statusParagraph.setAttribute('hidden', true);
      showHideBtn.textContent = 'show';
      showHideBtn.setAttribute('aria-expanded', 'false');
      activateBtn.setAttribute('disabled', true);
    }
  });

  activateBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
    if (activateBtn.textContent === 'activate') {
      statusParagraph.textContent = 'this is active';
      statusParagraph.classList.remove('inactive');
      statusParagraph.classList.add('active');
      activateBtn.textContent = 'deactivate';
    } else {
      statusParagraph.textContent = 'this is inactive';
      statusParagraph.classList.remove('active');
      statusParagraph.classList.add('inactive');
      activateBtn.textContent = 'activate';
    }
  });
</script>
```

As you can see, for each condition, we have to use JavaScript to modify everything in the DOM that has changed taking into account the previous state.

### Declarative Approach

The declarative approach simplifies the process by focusing on _what_ should happen. The UI updates automatically in response to changes in state. Here is a similar example using the Interactivity API's declarative approach:

```html
<!-- Render.php file -->
<button
  data-wp-on--click="actions.toggleVisibility"
  data-wp-bind--aria-expanded="state.isVisible"
  data-wp-text="state.visibilityText"
  aria-controls="status-paragraph"
>
  show
</button>
<button
  data-wp-on--click="actions.toggleActivation"
  data-wp-bind--disabled="!state.isVisible"
  data-wp-text="state.activationText"
>
  activate
</button>
<p
  id="status-paragraph"
  data-wp-bind--hidden="!state.isVisible"
  data-wp-class--active="state.isActive"
  data-wp-class--inactive="!state.isActive"
  data-wp-text="state.paragraphText"
>
  this is inactive
</p>
```

```js
// view.js file
import { store } from '@wordpress/interactivity';

const { state } = store('myPlugin', {
  state: {
    isVisible: false,
    isActive: false,
    get visibilityText() {
      return state.isVisible ? 'hide' : 'show';
    },
    get activationText() {
      return state.isActive ? 'deactivate' : 'activate';
    },
    get paragraphText() {
      return state.isActive ? 'this is active' : 'this is inactive';
    },
  },
  actions: {
    toggleVisibility() {
      state.isVisible = !state.isVisible;
      if (!state.isVisible) state.isActive = false;
    },
    toggleActivation() {
      state.isActive = !state.isActive;
    },
  },
});
```

In this declarative example, the UI automatically updates based on the current state. All we have to do as developers is to declare the necessary state, any derived state, the actions that modify the state, and which parts of the DOM depend on which parts of the state. The framework takes care of making all the necessary updates to the DOM so that it is always in sync with the current state. The logic remains simple and maintainable regardless of the number of elements controlled by the framework.

### Can you spot the bug?

In the imperative example, we intentionally introduced a bug. Can you find it? It's not easy!

<details>
<summary>Show me the answer!</summary>

In the case that the Show button is pressed first, then the Activate button, and finally the Hide button, we forgot to add the `inactive` class using `statusParagraph.classList.add('inactive');`. Therefore, the next time the user presses Show, the paragraph will not appear in red.

</details>

These types of bugs are very common in imperative code because we have to manually control all the conditions. On the other hand, they do not exist in declarative code because the framework takes care of updating the DOM and never forgets about anything :)

### Benefits of the Declarative Approach

As demonstrated, the imperative approach requires detailed steps and direct manipulation of the DOM, which can quickly become complex and hard to maintain as the application grows. The more possible states and elements there are, the more conditional logic needs to be added, making the code exponentially more complicated. The declarative approach, on the other hand, simplifies the process by managing the state and letting the framework handle the DOM updates. This leads to more readable, maintainable, and scalable code.

By adopting a declarative mindset, developers can leverage the Interactivity API to create dynamic and interactive applications more efficiently. Since everything is tied to the state, modifying the state will automatically update the entire application to the correct state. Understanding this core concept is essential for mastering the Interactivity API and writing effective code.

## Understanding Reactivity

The Interactivity API is a declarative framework thanks to its leverage of reactivity. In a reactive system, changes to the data automatically trigger updates in the user interface, ensuring that the view always reflects the current state of the application.

### How Reactivity Works

The Interactivity API uses a fine-grained reactivity system. Here's how it works:

1. **Reactive State**: In the Interactivity API, both the state and the context (from the `data-wp-context` directive) are reactive. This means that when either of these data sources changes, any parts of the UI that depend on them will automatically update.

   - **State**: This is global data that can be accessed throughout your application.
   - **Context**: This is local data that is specific to a particular element and its children.

2. **Derived State**: In addition to basic state properties, you can define computed properties (derived state) that automatically update when their dependencies change.

3. **Actions**: These are functions that modify the state.

4. **Reactive Bindings**: HTML elements are bound to state values using special attributes like `data-wp-bind`, `data-wp-text`, or `data-wp-class`.

5. **Automatic Updates**: When the state or context changes (through actions), the Interactivity API automatically updates all parts of the DOM that depend on that state (or derived state).

Let's break down these concepts with an example from the code we've seen:

```javascript
import { store } from '@wordpress/interactivity';

const { state } = store('myPlugin', {
  state: {
    isVisible: false,
    isActive: false,
    get visibilityText() {
      return state.isVisible ? 'hide' : 'show';
    },
    // ... other derived state
  },
  actions: {
    toggleVisibility() {
      state.isVisible = !state.isVisible;
    },
    // ... other actions
  },
});
```

In this code:

- `isVisible` and `isActive` are basic state properties.
- `visibilityText` is a derived state that automatically updates when `isVisible` changes.
- `toggleVisibility` is an action that modifies the state.

The HTML bindings look like this:

```html
<button
  data-wp-on--click="actions.toggleVisibility"
  data-wp-text="state.visibilityText"
  data-wp-bind--aria-expanded="state.isVisible"
>
  show
</button>
```

Here's how reactivity works in practice:

1. When the button is clicked, it triggers the `toggleVisibility` action.
2. This action updates `state.isVisible`.
3. The Interactivity API detects this change and automatically:
   - Updates the button's text content (because of `data-wp-text="state.visibilityText"`).
   - Changes the `aria-expanded` attribute (due to `data-wp-bind--aria-expanded="state.isVisible"`).
   - Updates any other parts of the DOM that depend on `isVisible` or `visibilityText`.

### Mutable Updates

Unlike many other reactive frameworks, the Interactivity API does not require the use of immutability when updating state or context. You can directly mutate objects and arrays, and the reactivity system will still work as expected. This can lead to more intuitive and straightforward code in many cases.

For example, you can push to an array like this:

```javascript
import { store } from '@wordpress/interactivity';

const { state } = store('myPlugin', {
  state: {
    items: ['item 1', 'item 2'],
  },
  actions: {
    addItem() {
      // Right:
      state.items.push('new item');

      // Wrong:
      state.items = [...state.items, 'new item']; // Don't do this!
    },
  },
});
```

There's no need to create a new array or use the spread operator as you might in other frameworks. The Interactivity API will detect this change and update any parts of the UI that depend on `state.items`.

### Side Effects

In addition to automatically updating the UI, the Interactivity API allows you to perform side effects when reactive data changes using directives like `data-wp-watch`. Side effects are useful for tasks like logging, making API calls, or updating other parts of your application that aren't directly tied to the UI.

Here's an example of how you might use `data-wp-watch`:

```html
<div data-wp-watch="callbacks.logCount">
  <p>Count: <span data-wp-text="state.count"></span></p>
  <button data-wp-on--click="actions.increment">Increment</button>
</div>
```

```javascript
import { store } from '@wordpress/interactivity';

const { state } = store('myPlugin', {
  state: {
    count: 0,
  },
  actions: {
    increment() {
      state.count += 1;
    },
  },
  callbacks: {
    logCount: () => {
      console.log(`The count is now: ${state.count}`);
    },
  },
});
```

In this example:

1. We have a simple counter implemented using the local context.
2. The `data-wp-watch` directive is set to `callbacks.logCount`.
3. Every time `state.count` changes, the `logCount` callback will be executed.
4. The `logCount` callback logs the current count to the console.

This allows you to create powerful side effects that automatically run in response to data changes. Some other use cases for `data-wp-watch` might include:

- Saving data to localStorage when it changes.
- Sending analytics events.
- Updating the page title, meta tags, or body attributes.
- Triggering animations.

### Benefits of Reactivity in the Interactivity API

1. **Simplicity**: You can focus on your data and logic without worrying about manually updating the UI.
2. **Consistency**: The UI is always in sync with your data, reducing the chance of inconsistencies.
3. **Performance**: Only the parts of the UI that need to change are updated, leading to efficient rendering.

By leveraging the reactive nature of the Interactivity API, you can create dynamic, responsive WordPress interfaces with less code and fewer bugs. The system takes care of the complex task of keeping your UI in sync with your data, allowing you to focus on building great features for your users.
