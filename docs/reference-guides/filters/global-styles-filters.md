# Global Styles Filters

WordPress 6.1 has introduced some server-side filters to hook into the data provided to Global Styles & Settings:

- `global_styles_default`
- `global_styles_blocks`
- `global_styles_theme`
- `global_styles_user`

Each of this filter allows consumers to update the data provided by the different layers of data.
