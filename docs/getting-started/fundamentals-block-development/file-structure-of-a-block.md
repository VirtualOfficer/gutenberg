# File structure of a block

At its simplest, a block in the WordPress block editor is a JSON object with a specific set of properties that is registered in the system so it can be used.

The recommended way to register a block is via a plugin. With the `create-block` tool you can quickly scaffold the structure of the files required to create a plugin tha registers a block. 

The files generated by this tool are a good reference of the files that can be involved in the definition and registration of a block.

### `<plugin-file>.php`

A block is usually added to the block editor using a WordPress plugin. In the main PHP file of the plugin the block is usually registered on the server side.

### `package.json`

[`package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json) is a configuration file for a NodeJs project. In this file you define the NPM dependencies of the block and the scripts used for local work.

### `src` folder

In a standard project you'll place your block files in the `src` folder. By default, the build process with `wp-scripts `will take files from this folder and will generate the bundled files in the `build` folder. 

### `block.json`

This files contains the metadata of the block, and it's required for its registration. Among other things it provides properties to define the files you need to be part of the definition of the block:
- `editorScript` → `index.js` by default
- `style` → `style-index.css` (output build for `style.scss`) by default
- `editorStyle` → `index.css` (output build for `editor.scss`) by default
- `render` → `render.php` by default
- `viewScript` → `view.js` by default

### `index.js`

The `index.js` file (or any other file defined in the `editorScript` property of `block.json`) is the entry point file for javascript files and it usually registers the block in the client. In a standard structure it imports the `edit.js` and `save.js` files to get functions required in block registration.

### `edit.js`

The `edit.js` file usually returns the `edit` function used in block registration that defines the React component that will be loaded on the Editor when the block is loaded or inserted.

### `save.js`

The `save.js` file usually returns the `save` function used in block registration that defines the markup used to save the block in the DB.

### `style.scss`

The `style.scss` file contains the styles of the block that will be loaded in both the editor and the frontend. In the build process this file is converted into `style-index.css` which is usually defined at `style` property in `block.json`


### `editor.scss`

The `editor.scss` file contains the additional styles applied to the block only in the editor’s context. In the build process this file is converted into `index.css` which is usually defined at `editorStyle` property in `block.json`

### `render.php`

The `render.php` file (or any other file defined in the `render` property of `block.json`) defines the server side process that returns the markup for the block when there is a request from the frontend. If this file is defined, it will take precedence over any other ways to render the block's markup for the frontend.

### `view.js`

The `view.js` file (or any other file defined in the `view` property of `block.json`) will be loaded in the front-end when the block is displayed.

### `build` folder

In a standard project, the `build` folder contains the generated files in the build process triggered by the `build` or `start` commands of `wp-scripts`.
