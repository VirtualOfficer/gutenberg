# Curating the Editor Experience

The purpose of this guide is to offer various ways one can lock down and curate the experience of using WordPress, especially with the introduction of more design tools and full site editing functionality. 

For information around adding functionality to a theme, rather than curating and locking, please review this guide on [Converting a classic theme to a block theme](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/block-themes/converting-a-classic-theme-to-a-block-theme/).



## Combining approaches

Keep in mind that the above approaches can be combined as you see fit. For example, you can provide custom patterns to use when creating a new page while also limiting the amount of customization that can be done to aspects of them, like only allowing certain preset colors to be used for the background of a Cover block or locking down what blocks can be deleted. When considering the approaches to take, think about the specific ways you might want to both open up the experience and curate it.
