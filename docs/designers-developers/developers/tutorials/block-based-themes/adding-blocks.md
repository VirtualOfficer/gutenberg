# Adding blocks

Each template or template part contains the [block grammar](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/principles/key-concepts/#blocks), the HTML, for the selected blocks.

There is more than one way to add blocks to the theme files:

-Adding and editing blocks in the site editor and exporting the theme.
-Adding block grammar to the HTML files manually.

## Adding blocks using the site editor

The beta site editor is available from the WordPress admin area when full site editing is enabled.
To use the site editor, a full site editing theme must be installed and active.

The site editor works similar to the block editor, but for the site layout instead of the post and page content.

In the top toolbar there is a new menu that lists the templates and template parts.
Hovering over the parts will show a preview.

You can see the current home page and lists of posts, pages, and categories.

By selecting a page, you can edit the template used for all pages, or, you can create, edit and save a template
that is specific for that page.

When the example theme is active and viewed in the site editor, you will see a blank page with a dark grey background,
because the theme has no blocks yet.

Select the header template part.
In the editor you can now add a site title block, a menu, and perhaps a header image.

When you have made your changes, click on the update design button in the upper right corner,
where you normally publish and update your content.

Next, select the footer template part and add some example content.

Select the index template to view the temlate parts in the page context.
