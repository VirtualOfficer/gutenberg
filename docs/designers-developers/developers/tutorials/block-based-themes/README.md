# Creating a block-based theme

## What is a block-based theme?

A block-based theme is a WordPress theme with templates entirely composed of blocks so that in addition to the post content of the different post types (pages, posts, ...), 
the block editor can also be used to edit all areas of the site: headers, footers, sidebars, etc.

Please see the documentation for block-based themes https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/developers/themes/block-based-themes/
