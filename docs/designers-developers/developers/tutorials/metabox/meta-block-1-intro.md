# Store Post Meta with a Block

You can create a block whose sole purpose is to collect data to be used elsewhere. In this short tutorial you will create a meta block that prompts the user for a single value.

For background around the thinking of blocks as the interface, please see the [Principles section](../../../../../docs/contributors/principles.md) of the handbook.

Let's get started. First up you need a plugin to hold your code. Please take a look at the first two steps of [the JavaScript tutorial](../../../../../docs/designers-developers/developers/tutorials/javascript/readme.md) for information setting up a plugin.
