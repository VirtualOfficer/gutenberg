# Creating a sidebar for your plugin

In this tutorial we're going to create a sidebar for our plugin that takes as input a value stored in the `post_meta` table and updates it accordingly.

1. [Get a sidebar up and running](./plugin-sidebar-1-up-and-running.md)
2. [Tweak the sidebar style and add controls](./plugin-sidebar-2-styles-and-controls.md)
3. [Connect the input component to the meta field](./plugin-sidebar-3-connect-to-meta.md)
