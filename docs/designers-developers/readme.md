# Designer & Developer Handbook

Gutenberg is a transformation of the WordPress editor for working with content.

Using a system of blocks to compose and format content, the new editor is designed to create rich, flexible layouts for websites and digital products.

Blocks treat paragraphs, headings, media, embeds, shortcodes, and other elements as components, instead of the classic method of using freeform text. Strung together, the components make up the object-based content stored in the WordPress database, replacing the traditional text-based storage model.

The new editor is designed to accept content created using the traditional editor in several ways; it is backward-compatible with all legacy content, offers a process to try to convert and split a classic block into block equivalents using client-side parsing, and finally the blocks offer enhanced editing and format controls. The editor also offers rich new value to users with visual, drag-and-drop creation tools and powerful developer enhancements with modern vendor packages, reusable components, rich APIs and hooks to modify and extend the editor through Custom Blocks, Custom Block Styles and Plugins
