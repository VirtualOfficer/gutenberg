This whole post is composed of <em>pieces of content</em>—somewhat similar to LEGO bricks—that you can move around and interact with. Move your cursor around and you\'ll notice the different blocks light up with outlines and arrows. Press the arrows to reposition blocks quickly, without fearing about losing things in the process of copying and pasting.</p>',
			'<p>What you are reading now is a <strong>text block</strong>, the most basic block of all. A text block can have multiple paragraphs, if that\'s how you prefer to write your posts. But you can also split it by hitting enter twice. Once blocks are split they get their own controls to be moved freely around the post...</p>',

That\'s the spirit behind the inserter—the (+) button you\'ll see around the editor—which allows you to browse all available content blocks and insert them into your post. Plugins and themes are able to register their own, opening up all sort of posibilities for rich editing and publishing.<p>Go give it a try, you may discover things WordPress can already insert into your posts that you didn\'t know about. Here\'s a short list of what you can currently find there:</p>',

			'<!-- wp:core/text -->',

			'<!-- /wp:core/text -->',

			'<!-- wp:core/text -->',
			'<p>Blocks can be anything you need. For instance, you may want to insert a subdued quote as part of the composition of your text, or you may prefer to display a giant stylized one. All of these options are available in the inserter.</p>',
