This whole post is composed of <em>pieces of content</em>—somewhat similar to Lego bricks—that you can move around and interact with. Move your cursor around and you\'ll notice the different blocks light up with outlines and arrows. Press the arrows to reposition blocks quickly, without fearing about losing things in the process of copying and pasting.</p>',
			'<p>What you are reading now is a <strong>text</strong> <strong>block</strong>, the most basic block of all. A text block can have multiple paragraphs, if that\'s how you prefer to write your posts. But you can also split it by hitting enter twice. Once blocks are split they get their own controls to be moved freely around the post...</p>',

No need to figure out HTML tags, classes, or remember shortcode syntax. That\'s the spirit behind the inserter—the (+) button you\'ll see around the editor—which allows you to browse all available content blocks and insert them into your post. Plugins and themes will be able to register their own. Go give it a try, you may discover things WordPress can insert into your posts that you didn\'t know about.</p>',
