I’m a student from Algeria and want to learn Machine learning. I think it will be beneficial for my thesis work. But I’ve no job of my own to carry the expenses to pay for the certificate for this course. I live only on my scholarship ( about $37 per month). In this circumstance, it is very difficult for me to gather such much money for the certificate. Financial Aid will help me take this course without adversely impacting my monthly essential needs. So I’m badly in need of this financial aid. I want to take this course as I want to be a machine learning engineer. This course will boost my job prospects after graduation from my institute. It will help me perform better in carrying out machine learning and give me an edge over my competitors. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course. I plan to complete all assignments on or before time as I have done in previous Signature Track Courses. Also, I intend to participate in discussion forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses I have taken on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments that are too peer-reviewed which I believe will be an invaluable learning opportunity.
