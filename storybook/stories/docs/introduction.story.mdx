# Introduction

## Welcome! 
The WordPress Gutenberg project uses Storybook to view and work with the UI components 
developed in the WordPress package [@wordpress/components](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/trunk/packages/components). 
On this interactive site you can browse single components, 
their controls, options, and settings in isolation, modify controls and arguments and see the changes right away. 

The site shows the Components in the sidebar and the Canvas on the right. 
Select the component you’d like to explore, and you’ll see the display on the Canvas tab. 
If the component also has controls/arguments, you can modify them on the Controls tab on the lower half of the screen. 

To view the documentation for each component use the Docs menu item in the top toolbar. 

For local use in your development environment `npm run storybook:dev` from the top-level Gutenberg directory
