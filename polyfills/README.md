# Locally-maintained polyfills

We try to use third-party polyfills where possible but do not always find what we need. Even when we write our own, it's good to give back to the polyfill repositories we use like the [Financial Times' polyfill-service](https://github.com/Financial-Times/polyfill-service), but we do not control whether or when our polyfills will be merged and included with a new release. This is a place where we can maintain our own polyfills as needed.

## DOMRect

The DOMRect polyfill has been [submitted to the Financial Times' polyfill-service](https://github.com/Financial-Times/polyfill-service/pull/1732), but at of July 12, 2018, it has not been reviewed or merged. We need this polyfill, so we'll maintain a version here in the meantime.
