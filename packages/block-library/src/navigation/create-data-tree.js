/**
 * Creates a nested, hierarchical tree representation from unstructured data that
 * has an inherent relationship defined between individual items.
 *
 * For example, by default, each element in the dataset should have an `id` and
 * `parent` property where the `parent` property indicates a relationship between
 * the current item and another item with a matching `id` propertys.
 *
 * This is useful for building linked lists of data from flat data structures.
 *
 * @param {Array} dataset linked data to be rearranged into a hierarchical tree based on relational fields.
 * @param {string} id the property which uniquey identifies each entry within the array.
 * @param {*} relation the property which identifies how the current item is related to other items in the data (if at all).
