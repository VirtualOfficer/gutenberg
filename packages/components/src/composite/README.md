# `Composite`

`Composite` provides a single tab stop on the page and allows navigation through the focusable descendants with arrow keys. This abstract component is based on the [WAI-ARIA Composite Role‚Å†](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#composite).

See the [Ariakit docs for the `Composite` component](https://ariakit.org/components/composite).
