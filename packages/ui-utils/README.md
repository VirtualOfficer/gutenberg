<a name="isDefined" href="#isDefined">#</a> **isDefined**

Checks whether a value is defined, asserting that it is neither
null nor undefined.

_Parameters_

-   _value_ `(T|undefined|null)`: The value to check.

_Returns_

-   (unknown type): Whether the value is undefined.

<a name="isObjectInterpolation" href="#isObjectInterpolation">#</a> **isObjectInterpolation**

There's no way to detect whether an `any` type is an `ObjectInterpolation` because `ObjectInterpolation`s
are merely objects where the keys are either (1) [CSS property names](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/blob/a72e6dc0f326b7d3d6067698d433018ee8c4cbf1/packages/serialize/types/index.d.ts#L10),
(2) [CSS Pseudo property names](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/blob/a72e6dc0f326b7d3d6067698d433018ee8c4cbf1/packages/serialize/types/index.d.ts#L18),
or (3) [anything else where the value for the key is another interpolation](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/blob/a72e6dc0f326b7d3d6067698d433018ee8c4cbf1/packages/serialize/types/index.d.ts#L19).
That means ObjectInterpolations can look all of the following ways:

```js
const oi = {
  color: 'black',
};

const oi = {
  ':disabled': css`color: black;`,
};

const oi = {
  '@media (prefers-color-scheme: light)': css({
    backgroundColor: 'black',
    color: 'white',
  }),
};
```

Therefore, this function only accepts `TemplateStringsArray` and `Interpolation` for it's arguments rather than `any`, which
cannot be refined to an `ObjectInterpolation`. However, given any generic `Interpolation`, we _can_ tell whether it is an
`ObjectInterpolation` specifically by simply checking whether the value is "plain object" as defined by `lodash`'s `isPlainObject`.

Note: The links above reference a specific commit for **Emotion 10**. Emotion 11 is out but we're stuck on Emotion 10 until we can
re-write `create-styles` and upgrade all of `@wordpress/components` to use the new version of Emotion.

At that point we'll have to revisit this function anyway as it seems that the `ObjectInterpolation` type no longer
exists and that the concept has evolved.

_Parameters_

-   _value_ (unknown type): The value to check.

_Returns_

-   (unknown type): Whether the value is an ObjectInterpolation.
