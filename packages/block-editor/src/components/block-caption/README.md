## Block Caption

The `BlockCaption` component renders block-level UI for adding and editing captions. It wraps logic around the more generic `Caption` component to provide an editable caption field that is designed specifically for block-level use.

`BlockCaption` is used in several native blocks, including `Video`, `Image`, `Audio`, etc.
