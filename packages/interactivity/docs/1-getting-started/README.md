# Getting started with the Interactivity API

> **Note**
> This Interactivity API [is currently in a experimental phase](#) 

The Interactivity API is a standard system of directives, based on declarative code, for adding frontend interactivity to blocks. 

## Requirements

To get started with Interactivity API you'll need to have a [proper WordPress development environment for blocks](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/) which should include:

- A local WordPress installation
- Gutenberg 16.2 or superior
- Node v14

### A local WordPress installation

You can use [the tool to set your local WordPress environment](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/#wordpress-development-site) you feel more comfortable with. To get started, [`wp-now`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wp-now/wp-now) is the fastest way to get a WordPress site up and running. 

### Gutenberg 16.2 or superior

The Interactivity API is currently only available as an experimental feature from Gutenberg 16.2, so you'll need to have the Gutenberg plugin with this version (or a superior one), installed and activated.

### Node v14

Block development requires Node, so you also need to get [Node v14](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/#node-development-tools) installed and running on your machine
