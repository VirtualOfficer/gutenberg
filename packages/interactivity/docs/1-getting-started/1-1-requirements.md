# Requirements

To get started with Interactivity API you'll need to have a [proper WordPress development environment for blocks](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/) which should include:

- A local WordPress installation
- Gutenberg 16.2 or superior
- Node v14

## A local WordPress installation

You can use [the tools to set your local WordPress environment](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/#wordpress-development-site) you feel more comfortable with. 

To get started, [`wp-now`](https://github.com/WordPress/playground-tools/tree/trunk/packages/wp-now) is the fastest way to get a WordPress site up and running. 

## Gutenberg 16.2 or superior

The Interactivity API is currently only available as an experimental feature from Gutenberg 16.2, so you'll need to have the Gutenberg plugin with this version or a superior one, installed and activated in your WordPress installation.

## Node v14

Block development requires Node, so you also need to ensure you have [Node v14](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/#node-development-tools) installed and running on your machine
