# Edit Post

Edit Post Module for WordPress.

> This package is meant to be used only with WordPress core. Feel free to use it in your own project but please keep in mind that it might never get fully documented.

## Installation

Install the module

```bash
npm install @wordpress/edit-post
```

_This package assumes that your code will run in an **ES2015+** environment. If you're using an environment that has limited or no support for such language features and APIs, you should include [the polyfill shipped in `@wordpress/babel-preset-default`](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/HEAD/packages/babel-preset-default#polyfill) in your code._

## Extending the post editor UI

Extending the editor UI can be accomplished with the `registerPlugin` API, allowing you to define all your plugin's UI elements in one place.

Refer to [the plugins module documentation](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/HEAD/packages/plugins/README.md) for more information.

The components exported through the API can be used with the `registerPlugin` ([see documentation](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/HEAD/packages/plugins/README.md)) API.
They can be found in the global variable `wp.editPost` when defining `wp-edit-post` as a script dependency.
