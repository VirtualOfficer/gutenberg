// The Block Type is the most important concept within the block API. It defines
// all aspects of the block configuration and its interfaces (including "edit"
// and "save"). The transforms specification allows converting one block type to
// another. Transforming a block into another block can be a destructive
// operation depending on the heuristics established by the two blocks (the
// source and the destination).

// The block tree is composed of a collection of block nodes. Blocks contained
// within other blocks are called "inner blocks". An important design
// consideration is that inner blocks are -- conceptually -- not part of the
// territory established by the parent block that contains them.
//
// This has multiple practical implications: when parsing, we can safely dispose
// of any block boundary found within a block from the innerHTML property when
// transfering to state. Not doing so has a compounding effect on memory and
// uncertainty over the source of truth since, given a tree of n nested blocks,
// the entry node would have to contain the actual content of each block while
// each subsequent block node in the state tree would replicate the whole chain
// n-1, meaning the extreme end would have been replicated n times as the tree
// is traversed and would generate uncertainty as to which one is to hold the
// current value of the block. For composition, it also means inner blocks can
// effectively be child components whose mechanisms can be shielded from the
// `edit` implementation and just passed along.

// The process of serialization aims to deflate the internal memory of the block
// editor and its state representation back into an HTML document. This process

// block with HTML comment boundaries which can contain any extra attributes
// needed to operate with the block later on.

// "Validation" is the process of comparing a block source with its output
// before there is any user input or interaction with a block. When this
// operation fails -- for whatever reason -- the block is to be considered
// invalid. As part of validating a block the system will attempt to run the
// source against any provided deprecation definitions.
//
// Worth emphasizing that validation is not a case of whether the markup is
// "valid" in terms of being HTML spec-compliant but about how the editor knows
// to create such markup and that its inability to create an identical result
// can be a strong indicator of potential data loss (the invalidation is then a
// protective measure).
//
// The invalidation process can also be deconstructed in phases: 1) validate the
// block exists; 2) validate the source matches output; 3) validate the source
// matches deprecated outputs; 4) validate the significance of differences.
// These are stacked in a way that favors performance and optimizes for the
// majority of cases. That is to say, the evaluation logic can become more
// sophisticated the further down it goes in the process. The first few checks
// have to be extremely efficient since they will be run for all valid blocks.
// However, once a block is detected as invalid -- failing the three first steps
// -- it is adequate to spend more time determining validity before throwing a
// conflict.

// Blocks are inherently indifferent about where the data they operate with ends
// up being saved. For example, all blocks can have a static and dynamic aspect
// to them depending on the needs. The static nature of a block is the "save"
// definition that is meant to be serialized into HTML and which can be left
// null. Any block can also register a "render_callback" on the server, which
// makes their output dynamic either in part or in its totality.
//
// "Child" blocks are defined as a relationship that builds on top of the inner
// blocks mechanism. A child block is a block node that can only exist within
// the inner block boundaries of a specific parent. This allows block authors to
// compose specific block nodes that are not meant to be used outside of a
// specific context. Thus, child blocks extend the concept of inner blocks to
// support a more direct relationship between sets of blocks. The addition of
// parentâ€“child would be a subset of the inner block functionality under the
// premise that certain blocks only make sense as children of another block.
